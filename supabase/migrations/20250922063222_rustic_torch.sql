  # Fix RLS policies for bookings table

  1. Security Changes
    - Drop existing restrictive policies that block anon users
    - Add permissive policies for anon role to allow booking operations
    - Allow anon users to INSERT, UPDATE, and SELECT bookings
    - This enables the booking system to work properly

  Note: These policies are designed for a booking system where anonymous users
  can create and manage bookings. For production, consider implementing
  authentication and more restrictive policies.
