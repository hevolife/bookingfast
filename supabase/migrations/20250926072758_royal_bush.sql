  # Fix RLS policies for email and settings access by team members

  1. Email Templates
    - Allow team members with 'view_emails' permission to view owner's templates
    - Allow team members with 'create_workflow' or 'edit_workflow' permissions to modify templates

  2. Email Workflows  
    - Allow team members with 'view_emails' permission to view owner's workflows
    - Allow team members with workflow permissions to manage workflows

  3. Business Settings
    - Allow team members with 'view_admin' permission to view owner's settings
    - Allow team members with 'edit_business_settings' permission to modify settings
