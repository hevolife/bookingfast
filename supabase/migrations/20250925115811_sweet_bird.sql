/*
  # Fix infinite recursion in account_users policies

  1. Policy Changes
    - Drop existing policies that cause recursion
    - Create simplified policies that avoid circular references
    - Use direct user ID comparisons instead of complex subqueries

  2. Security
    - Maintain proper access control
    - Avoid self-referencing queries in policies
