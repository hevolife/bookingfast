  # Fix services RLS policy for team members

  1. Security Updates
    - Update RLS policy on `services` table to allow team members to view owner's services
    - Allow team members to access services based on their team membership

  2. Changes
    - Modify existing policy to include team member access
    - Team members can view services where they have team access to the owner
*/
