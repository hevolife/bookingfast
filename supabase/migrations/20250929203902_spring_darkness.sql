  # Fix Row Level Security Policies

  1. Security Updates
    - Drop existing conflicting policies on bookings and services tables
    - Create comprehensive RLS policies for authenticated users
    - Ensure team members can access owner's data
    - Allow public access for booking functionality

  2. Tables Updated
    - `bookings` - Allow users to access their own bookings and team member bookings
    - `services` - Allow users to access their own services and team member services
    - Maintain public read access for booking functionality

  3. Policy Structure
    - Authenticated users can manage their own data
    - Team members can access owner's data through team_members table
    - Public users can view data needed for booking process
